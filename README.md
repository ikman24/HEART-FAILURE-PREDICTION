# HEART-FAILURE-PREDICTION
literature review
This study's classification goal is to determine whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing heart disease. Research into other people's approaches to exploring heart disease prediction was conducted prior to the experiments in order to broaden our horizons and gain insight from their experiences.
Avinash Golande and et. al.: investigate various ML algorithms that can be used to classify heart disease. A study was conducted to compare the accuracy of classification algorithms like Decision Tree, KNN, and K-Means. This study found that Decision Trees were the most accurate, and that they can be made more efficient using different techniques and parameter tuning.
S. Palaniappan and R. Awang in 2008 came up with an expert medical diagnosis system that could help people find out if they have heart disease. In the development of the system, machine learning models like navies bays (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Artificial Neural Network were used. The NB, the ANN, and the DT classifier all had 86.12% accuracy, and the DT classifier had 80.44% accuracy, too.
Soni, J (2011) has created an ML model that compares three different algorithms to see which one is the best one. During this study, the accuracy of Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and KNN algorithms for classifying data was compared to see which one was best. Decision trees were the most accurate method of making a choice.
